### regextutor

This is a simple tool to help teach regular expressions.  This was a class project that I ported to python many years ago.  It has bugs, but it gets the point across.

I dust it off every few years for presentations.

### Install Dependencies

I've only tested this on linux.

 * pyparsing
 * wx

On Debian-derivatives:

```apt install python3-pyparsing python3-wxgtk4.0```

(may work with other versions of wx)
